    "Best tv in the segment. I bought this tv after a long research in YouTube and many articles.\n\nPros :\n1. Best tv in the price range , I bought it under 30k by using card offers\n2. The performance of the tv is really well and it's really bright and watching 4k video was awesome\n3. The sound of tv is super, no need of sub woofer until you need a theatre experience.\n4. The viewing angle was good , as I tried from few side angles\n\nCons :\n1. After a month , I felt some lag in the tv perfomance, but after a watching a youtube video , I reduced the settings and animation and few other things , that really boosted the speed of the tv\n------------\n\nI raised a service request and they also responded soon , but we can't a expect a speed of what we have in our mobile phones, because it's of minimum ram right?\nI haven't used the storage option to store my photos , as it may slow down the performance.\n\nOverall it's a best tv in the price segment good to buy\n\nRead more",
    "Very good and colourful panel, deep blacks, moderate viewing angles. Metal back feels solid. Speaker is also lound and clear.\nOne con is that TV sometimes get slow and ui frames caps to like 30 hz, but it is rare. Hope this issue gets solved by update.\nOverall if anyone wants fabulous picture quality this should be a very good option.\nI got the tv at 21750 during sale, so it is value for money product",
    "I bought it in August 2024 the packaging was good damage on executive delivered the product at my doorstep and the check the product whether it was damage or not then after 2 hours MI service centre technician called me for installation and they reach to my home within 1 hour and installed the product but I have to pay it extra 500 rupees for the Wall mount because the Wall mount was not including in the box but that is okay because the Wall mount brand is also MI, functionality of the product is good picture quality is good enough features of the product is good but the space of internal storage is not enough(only 8gb,free space is about 4gb)it should be 16GB or more for internal memory, installation was very quick and we are using the TV for last 2 month for me it's a good product I got it from Amazon at rupees of 20700 and extra 500 I paid for the Wall mount so basically it was a good deal but after that the TV was sold in great Indian festival at rupees of 17700 so I missed the opportunity to buy the product at a low price of that never mind, the product connectivity is good, picture quality was very good just go for it",
    "Brightness and Video Quality is Best. 4k UHD Videos are Crisp to view. Dolby audio only available in Optical Format and not in HDMI ARC. Audio output is also Good Quality. Overall Best TV. Installation done by Amazon person on delivery day itself quickly and efficiently which is a plus point.",
    "The worst ever sound quality. Good display but with performance lag! After a week, sound became weaker than it was in the beginning! No more option to replace the TV or replace with another brand!!",
    "Using this product for more than a month. Outstanding product . Value for money. Useless installation service . Third grade installation service .",
    "Writing this review after a month of purchasing the TV.\nFantastic performance very clear picture and sound.\nFully satisfied with purchasing on Amazon.\nSmart TV performance 10 out of 10",
    "Picture quality, build quality, everything is good except sound quality. Build in speakers are very worst, you have buy a external speaker if want to hear contents clearly"
  ],
  "aiReviewSummary": "Customers generally rave about the TV's exceptional picture quality, vibrant colors, and impressive sound for the price point, especially when paired with deals and discounts. However, several users experienced performance lags and occasional UI slowdowns, even after adjusting settings. While some found the installation process smooth, others criticized the poor quality of the installation service and the lack of internal storage space. \n"
